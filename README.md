Project Details
Overview
Our project emphasizes the critical importance of addressing climate change. We utilized publicly available NASA data related to greenhouse gas emissions, sea levels, and global temperatures to conduct a thorough analysis. The results of our work are presented in the form of a story, narrated by Shelly, a sea turtle struggling with the consequences of human-driven climate change. Shelly's story showcases how rising temperatures and sea levels are pushing her species closer to extinction, as her home faces imminent destruction.
How It Works
The heart of our project lies in the data analysis. We collected climate data and visualized the relationships between temperature increases, greenhouse gas emissions, and rising sea levels. This data was woven into Shelly's narrative on our custom website, making complex scientific information more relatable and digestible for a wide audience.
Tools and Technologies
To develop our project, we used the following tools and technologies:
Python: Utilized for data analysis and visualization, employing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn.
Google Sites: Used to build an engaging and accessible website for Shelly's story.
Notebook Editors: We relied on Google Colab and Visual Studio Code for coding and analysis.
Benefits and Goals
The primary benefit of our project is raising awareness about the devastating impact of climate change on life forms across the planet. By connecting hard data to a compelling narrative, we aim to inspire action and make people realize the urgency of the situation. Our hope is that through Shelly’s story, we can communicate the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and safeguarding our planet’s future.
